# Festival Booking System (Festis)
**A Web-Based Festival Booking Prototype – KTH x Umain**

---

## Overview

**Festis** is a web-based festival booking system developed at the **Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)** in collaboration with **Umain** as part of the *HI1039 Software Development Project* course.

Built by a team of five students, the project aimed to apply **agile methodologies** and **modern software engineering practices** to design and implement a scalable full-stack application.  
Festis enables users to explore festivals, view ticket availability, book tickets, and manage accounts through a responsive and intuitive interface.

## System Concept

Festis provides an accessible and engaging platform for festival-goers and administrators alike:

- **Users:** Browse and search festivals by name, artist, date, or location; manage bookings.  
- **Administrators:** Add and update festival and artist information.  
- **Backend:** RESTful API with PostgreSQL database ensures reliable and consistent data handling.

## Key Features

- Full-stack architecture: **React (TypeScript)** + **Spring Boot (Java)** + **PostgreSQL**  
- Secure authentication and user management  
- Modular, maintainable MVC + Repository pattern  
- Unit and integration testing with **JUnit** and **MockMvc**  
- Responsive UI using **Chakra UI** and **Lucide Icons**  
- Continuous deployment via **Netlify**, **Render**, and **neon.tech**
